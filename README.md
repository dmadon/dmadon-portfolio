# Deanna Madon Portfolio Page

Hello! I am excited to present this portfolio page to you. I am a job-seeker that is ready for a new challenge in the field of software development. My years of work experience have taught me the importance of collaboration, communication and time management. I have a strong work ethic and I take pride in doing quality work. 



## Description

This portfolio page will provide you with some important information about me:

* Information about my work ethic and core beliefs
* Links to a few of my projects, with room for more in the future (in the meantime, enjoy those sweet pics of the Starship Enterprise!)
* My contact information

## Process

* I began this page by creating a wireframe for the HTML
* Then, I created a new local repository on my computer and a remote GitHub repository to store my project
* Once my repository was up and running, I began to layout the structure of my page in my index.html file
* I put all my styling in a style.css file and added comments in the file to help organize it
* After testing all my links for accuracy, I added a whole lot of media queries to make sure my page will look good on all devices
